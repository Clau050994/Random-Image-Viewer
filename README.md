# Random Image Viewer

## Description
Random Image Viewer is a simple web application designed for beginners to practice their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It allows users to fetch and display a random image from a public API, such as Unsplash.

## Features

- **Fetch Button**: A button that users can click to request a random image from the API.
- **Image Display**: Showcases the fetched image. Initially, the image container is empty.
- **Styling**: Basic CSS styling to enhance the webpage's visual appeal. This includes customizable fonts, colors, and layout.

## API Integration
This application integrates with public APIs like Unsplash to fetch random images. An HTTP request is made to the API endpoint to retrieve the image data.

## Project Flow

1. User clicks the "Fetch" button to trigger an API request for a random image.
2. Once the image data is received, it is displayed on the webpage.
3. Users can fetch a new random image by clicking the button again.

## Learning Goals

- Structuring the webpage using **HTML**.
- Styling and layout with **CSS**.
- **JavaScript** interaction with the DOM and making API requests.
- Handling API responses and displaying dynamic content on the webpage.

## Optional Enhancements

- Display a loading indicator while fetching the image.
- Showcase additional information about the image, like the photographer's name and a direct link to the original source.
- Implement error handling mechanisms for failed API requests.
- Feature to filter images by category or topic.
